print("Hello World")
print("Pramod")


✅ Dynamically typed
Python determines the type of a variable during runtime, rather than during compilation.
age = 25
# The interpreter automatically determines the type of the variable:
print(type(age))  # Output: <class 'int'>

# You can also reassign a variable to a different type without any issues:
age = "twenty-five"
print(type(age))  # Output: <class 'str'>
